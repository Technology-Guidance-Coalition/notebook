# Simulation & Governance

#### _On Artificial Intelligence: Simulation & Governance_

##### _A Model for Data-Driven and AI-Assisted Administration_

## Speculations

- AI has reached, or will soon reach, a point where it may serve in the  
  capacity described below.

- AI may be used ethically and responsibly in the aid of governance and  
  administrative tasks. This may reasonably include:

  - policy advisory, including a ranking system for data availability
  - civic engineering & "system" optimization
  - provide a human-interface to civic knowledge exploration and reference
  - provide simulation facilities, with a reasonable margin-of-error for  
    discrepancies in model accuracy
  - Manage bureaucratic procedure by facilitating a chain-of-approval  
    with advisory, knowledge availability support, and record management.
