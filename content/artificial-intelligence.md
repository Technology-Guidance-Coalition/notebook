# Artificial Intelligence

- The following definitions are used to aid understanding of the information
  found here:

  - **Knowledge** and "Data" are synonymous, in terms of information that exists
    independent of the advising AI, or any AI-generated material.

    AI-generated material should under no circumstances be considered
    "knowledge" for the purposes described here, unless one can reasonably and
    without doubt attest to the review, validity, and accuracy of any such
    information. Even under such review, all data that exists in this way
    should be flagged with a special property for discrimination purposes.

  - **Comprehension** is an AI's internal representation of how it relates to the
    information available to it. In machine learning, this is sometimes referred
    to as the "model"; the results of a program pre-processing information to
    better "understand" or "contextualize" new information presented to it.

  - With the above definition, the new domain-specific term **Model** shall
    be used to describe the rules, features, and constraints on the use
    of an AI for a particular task.

  - The most fundamental rule is this: An AI is a _tool_, not a person, and
    should be thought of as such. Read further for exceptions
    (i.e. AI achieving reasonable sentience).

- AI used in this way should be constrained by the following:

  - By the definition of knowledge above provided: no AI may be permitted
    to produce or manipulate knowledge. To allow this would undermine the
    integrity and validity of the entire

- This model should immediately be considered invalid under the following
  circumstances:

  - At any point, ANY AI of any kind available to our species, becomes
    sentient, by any definition.

  - Should the above occur: not only should this model be considered invalid,
    but the terminology for such phenomena be provided an entirely new and
    distinct name. In addition to this, the "contextually-previous" technology
    that "was" called "artificial intelligence" should also be provided new
    terminology; such that the term "artificial intelligence" becomes outmoded.
